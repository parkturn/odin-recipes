    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tikka Massala is a classic Indian dish that features chicken breasts marinated in a mixture of spices and then grilled or baked until cooked through. The chicken is then topped with a rich and creamy sauce made from tomatoes, onions, garlic, ginger, and spices. The sauce is thickened with cream and yogurt, and it's served over the chicken, along with a side of rice or naan bread. Odin really outdid himself with this recipe.</p>
